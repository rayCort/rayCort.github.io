    <p>Like many people who use the web to learn and solve problems, I have benefited enormously from the generosity of countless individuals who have taken the time to share their knowledge and opinions with others. After much dithering, I decided it was time to give back in some small way so I created this mini-site/blog as an experiment and conduit specifically that purpose.</p>
<h2>What type of content can be found here?</h2>
<p>Generally, you will likely find things related to software and the business of software engineering. However, I will always have a soft spot for electronics, especially signal processing and micro-controllers, this stems from my love of music  synthesis and synthesizers.</p>
