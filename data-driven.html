  <p>For quite some time now it has been "trendy" for individuals, teams and organization to say they are data driven. Even if it the effectiveness is not there, it is a wonderful aspiration. I'm 100% on-board with using data as a tool to drive decisions.  Data have always been relevant to decision making, however, in recent years, everything  data, are the rock stars of the software industry.</p>
<p>Having completed a number of data science and machine learning MOOCs, I have come to the conclusion that a foundation in data science improves one's ability to be an effective data driven practitioner.</p>
<p><strong>What is data-driven?</strong> Probably different things to different people. However, for this discussion, this will suffice: <em>"The adjective data-driven means that progress in an activity is compelled by data, rather than by intuition or personal experience. It is often labeled as business jargon for what scientists call evidence-based decision making."</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-driven">Link</a></p>
<p><strong>What is data science?</strong> This definition works for me. <em>"Data science is an interdisciplinary field about processes and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, either structured or unstructured, which is a continuation of some of the data analysis fields such as statistics, data mining, and predictive analytics"</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science">Link</a></p>
<p><strong>What is a data scientist?</strong> Apparently, it is a synonym for unicorn. <a href="https://medium.com/clover-health/hiring-unicorns-e2d23a186ea1#.scmm454wt">Link</a></p>
<h4>What are some benefits of having a foundation in the principles of data sciences?</h4>
<ol>
<li>The skills and ability to root out vanity metrics</li>
<li>The skills and ability to recognize being fooled by randomness or bias </li>
<li>The skills to manage the bias-variance trade-off</li>
</ol>
<p>As more and more of our daily life become driven by machine learning algorithms in one form or another, let's not forget this insightful and important maxim: </p>
